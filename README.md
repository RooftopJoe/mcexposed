# MC Exposed

## Introduction

[MC Exposed](https://github.com/RooftopJoe/mcexposed) is a client-side semivanilla Minecraft mod that exposes a lot of in-game
information to the player in a configurable fashion. It does not change any of the vanilla mechanics nor does it add new content to
the game.

Some of the features provided by this mod may be considered a form of cheating on some servers so be sure to check with the
administrators to see whether you are allowed to use them on said servers. Furthermore, the use of this mod is prohibited in official
speedruns.
